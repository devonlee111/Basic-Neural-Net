# Basic-Neural-Net
An attempt at understanding and building a basic neural net. Currently written using only python, I plan to expand the number of languages used in the future.

# Notes
Currently only works using a single hidden layer

# Program Files
Python Code:

net.py:	The original code used to build the most basic neural net.

NN.py:	My modified version of the basic neural net.
